# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

[Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://big-bang-theory-game.vercel.app/) is an expanded version of the classic hand game "Rock Paper Scissors." It was popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory". The game adds two more elements to the original three, making it more complex and strategic.

In this game, each of the five elements can defeat two other elements and is defeated by two others. The relationships are as follows:

- Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard
- Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock
- Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper and poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock

The game is typically played between two players, each choosing one of the five elements simultaneously. The winner is determined based on the relationships between the chosen elements. For example, if one player chooses Rock and the other chooses Scissors, the player who chose Rock wins because Rock crushes Scissors.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock adds an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability to the classic game, making it a popular choice for those looking for a more challenging and engaging version of the original.
